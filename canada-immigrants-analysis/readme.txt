## Introduction

This repository contains the "International Migration Flows to and from Selected Countries: The 2015 Revision" dataset. The dataset provides annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. It includes information on both inflows and outflows of migrants and distinguishes between foreigners and nationals based on factors such as place of birth, citizenship, or place of previous/next residence. The data is collected from 45 countries and is valuable for analytical purposes, but it's important to be aware of the challenges related to comparability among available statistics.

## Data Quality and Comparability

Given that countries collecting and publishing data on international migration flows use different definitions and concepts to identify migrants, it's important to be aware of the limitations in comparability. Consider using standardization techniques or adjustments when making comparisons across countries.
